```

3 regression models. One for the 25, 50, or 75th? Do I also have to do for the top quantiles?

```{r}
quart_25 <- rq(purchase_amount ~ gender + subscription_status + previous_purchases + shipping_type + discount_applied + promo_code, data = df, tau = 0.75)
```

```{r}
round(summary(quart_25)$coef, 2)
```
